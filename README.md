# **REPOP** - REconstruct POpulations from Plates

## Overview

REPOP is a probabilistic modeling library designed to reconstruct bacterial population distributions from plate counting data. It provides efficient inference methods with built-in uncertainty quantification.

A more detailed explanation is available in our manuscript:  
**_REPOP: A Tool for Bacterial Population Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification from Plate Counts_**  
[Available as a preprint on BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.01.644179v1)

REPOP is optimized for ease of use and computational efficiency. While it has minimal dependencies, it benefits significantly from GPU acceleration.

## Installation & Dependencies

To install REPOP, simply clone the repository (or download the files, extract and put on folder) and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

REPOP requires only a few standard scientific computing libraries. These are installed automatically using the command above.
- `torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

### Running the Tutorial

To get started, check out the Jupyter notebook `Tutorial.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to use REPOP with plate counting data.

### Generating Synthetic Data

To generate synthetic data used in the manuscript, navigate to the `synth_data` folder and run:

```bash
python cases.py
```
