# **REPOP** - REconstruct POpulations from Plates

## Overview

REPOP is a probabilistic modeling library designed to reconstruct bacterial population distributions from plate counting data. It provides efficient inference methods with built-in uncertainty quantification.

A more detailed explanation is available in our manuscript:

REPOP is optimized for ease of use and computational efficiency. While it has minimal dependencies, it benefits significantly from GPU acceleration.

## Installation & Dependencies

REPOP requires only a few standard scientific computing libraries:

- `torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

These dependencies ensure a straightforward installation process with no additional complex requirements.

## Usage

### Running the Tutorial

To get started, check out the Jupyter notebook `Tutorial.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to use REPOP with plate counting data.

### Generating Synthetic Data

To generate synthetic data used in the manuscript, navigate to the `synth_data` folder and run:

```bash
python cases.py
```

### Generating Graphs in the manuscript

The graphs for Fig. 1 are generated when running the tutorial. All others can be generated by the respective python script with its number in the file's name.
